# Mean Authentication App
A restful API which is used to register users with MongoDB and authenticate with JWT (JSON web token).
This app was built with a Node.js, Express and Mongoose backend, and linked to an Angular front end.

To install the dependencies:-

npm install

To start the app:-

npm start

This should work however some of the Angular dependencies do seem to be a bit fickle - in particular the flash messages module. 
Message me if you are experiencing any issues in running the program.
